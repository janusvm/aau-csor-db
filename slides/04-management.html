# A closer look at PostgreSQL databases

???
In this section we will take another look at the components of a database, and how to work with them from an administrating point of view.

We'll set up a new database, look at how to organise it, define and populate tables for different users, all with SQL code.

---

## SQL is more than queries: `CREATE`

???
Until now, we've been using either pgAdmin or R to create objects on our PostgreSQL server.

Both ways, under the hood, are eventually reduced to SQL `CREATE` calls.

--

```sql
CREATE DATABASE name
    [ [ WITH ] [ OWNER [=] user_name ]
           [ TEMPLATE [=] template ]
           [ ENCODING [=] encoding ]
           [ LC_COLLATE [=] lc_collate ]
           [ LC_CTYPE [=] lc_ctype ]
           [ TABLESPACE [=] tablespace_name ]
           [ ALLOW_CONNECTIONS [=] allowconn ]
           [ CONNECTION LIMIT [=] connlimit ]
           [ IS_TEMPLATE [=] istemplate ] ]
```

???
This is the full syntax for creating a new database in PostgreSQL.

  * As usual, bracketed expressions are optional
  * Usually, the defaults are fine

--

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb
  WITH
  OWNER = csor;
```

???
Let's create a new database for this lecture (we'll delete it again later).

  * Set `OWNER` to `csor` and keep the rest at the defaults (by not specifying values)
  * In pgAdmin, if it's not showing up yet, select Databases and go to Object â†’ Refresh

## Overview of a database

.left-balanced[
![:center 80%](input/figs/db-overview.png)
]

???
So far, we've just been working with tables, but a PostgreSQL database is comprised of many things.

Since we won't be using most of them, I'll just sprint through the list, so consider this a shallow overview.

---

---

.right-balanced[
Contents of a PostgreSQL database:

  * **Casts**: specifications of how to convert between types
  * **Catalogs**: database metadata tables
  * **Event triggers**: automatic commands triggered by certain events
  * **Extensions**: plugins for PostgreSQL
  * **Foreign data wrappers**: methods to query external sources
  * **Languages**: procedural languages used to write user-defined functions
  * **Schemas**: collections of objects for organising data
]

???

  * Casts are functions for converting between types (can be useful if you e.g. define your own Types)
  * Catalogs contain metadata about your database. In one of the exercises, you'll try querying information from the catalog
  * Event triggers are commands that are executed automatically on certain "events"
  * Extensions are plugins that extend the functionality of the database
  * Foreign data wrappers lets you create so-called _foreign tables_ that are proxies for some other data source - it can be a flat file, or even another SQL database. Querying against such a table makes the FDW query the external source and return results as if it came from a table in your database
  * Languages are programming languages for writing functions, they need to be declared. PostgreSQL has its own, PL/pgSQL, but you can also use popular general purpose languages like Perl, Python, and of course C
  * Schemas can be thought of as similar to system file folders (except they can't be nested)

---

.right-balanced[
Contents of a _schema_:

  * **Collations**: sort order specifications
  * **Domains**: custom types with constraints
  * **FTS**: full text search related objects
  * **Foreign tables**: external data sources
  * **Functions**: user defined functions
  * **Materialized Views**: views stored as tables
  * **Sequences**: sequential number generators
  * **Tables**: collections of records
  * **Trigger functions**: automatically invoked functions
  * **Types**: custom types
  * **Views**: saved queries
]

???

  * Collations define sort orders for strings, and different such orders exists, e.g. for accented characters
  * Domains are like Types, except they have constraints; this can be useful to use instead of repeating constraints on different tables
  * FTS is used for more performant string searching (we won't be covering this though)
  * Foreign tables are objects used to query data sources that are not on the PostgreSQL server itself
  * Materialized views are Views that are stored as tables (more on this later)
  * Sequences are usually used for unique identifiers for rows in tables
  * Tables is where your data lives
  * Trigger functions are special functions that are invoked whenever an event associated with a table occurs (event triggers act more "globally")
  * Types are custom types, usually composite types (i.e. types composed of several primitive types)
  * Views are basically queries that are saved and can be used in place of tables (more on this later)

## Organising tables with schemas

Schemas are commonly used to group together related tables and restrict access, e.g.

--

  * Different schemas for different branches of a large company

???
For example, a supermarket chain might have data for its stores, and each location has a seperate schema, to which the regional manager has access, with analysts in HQ having access across multiple stores.

--

  * Seperate schemas for each user of a web application

???
Since you can restrict access for different users to different schemas, a way of organising user data is to assign each user to a different schema.

We'll look a little closer at this example

---

### Create users

```sql
SELECT current_database();
SELECT current_user;
SET ROLE postgres;
```

???
First, ensure you are logged into `testdb` as `postgres`.
(in pgAdmin, click on `testdb` in the sidebar, and _then_ open the query tool)

--

```sql
CREATE USER alice;
CREATE ROLE bob WITH LOGIN;
```

???
Let's create two users: `alice` and `bob`.
Two different ways:

  * `USER` has `LOGIN` privilege by default
  * `ROLE` does not have `LOGIN` by default

--

### Create schemas

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION alice;
ALTER USER alice SET search_path = alice;
```

Repeat with bob using pgAdmin's interface (right click on Schemas and select Create)

???
Try create a schema for each of `alice` and `bob`;

  * Create `alice`'s schema using the command shown
  * Create `bob`'s schema similarly to `alice` using pgAdmin's interface
    * the `search_path` option is found under Parameters

The configuration shown here will do the following:

  * Create a schema called `alice`, owned by `alice`
  * Set `alice`'s _search path_ to the `alice` schema; this makes it so that selecting from unqualified tables use the `alice` schema

---

### Create tables

--

```sql
SET ROLE alice;
CREATE TABLE alice.transactions (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  date date NOT NULL,
  account integer,
  amount double precision NOT NULL,
  comment varchar(20)
);
```

Repeat with Bob using pgAdmin - note the constraints.

---

### Insert values into the new tables

```sql
INSERT INTO alice.transactions (date, account, amount, comment)
VALUES ('2019-01-01', 12340001, 100.00, 'initial deposit'),
       ('2019-01-02', 12340001, -50.00, 'coffee funds');
INSERT INTO alice.transactions (date, account, amount)
VALUES ('2019-01-03', 12340002, 200.00);
INSERT INTO alice.transactions
VALUES (123, '2019-02-01', 12340001, -25.00, 'emergency coffee');
```

Make up some entries for Bob (make the `account` numbers different from `alice`'s)

Note the `id` column; the `serial` type automatically increments, but you can set it manually too

  * What happens if you add a record with auto-increment, when that `id` already exists?

--

There now are two tables called `transactions`, in each their own schema.

  * What happens if you `SELECT` from `transactions` as `alice`? As `bob`? As `csor`?
  * What happens if you `SELECT` from `bob.transactions` as `alice`? As `csor`?

name: views
class: snowstorm, middle, center

# Views

queries saved server-side

---

## What is a View?

--

  * Another way to present data from the database

--

  * Based on one or more tables

--

  * A query with an assigned name

---

## Create a view

```sql
SET ROLE alice;
CREATE VIEW balance AS (
  SELECT account,
         sum(amount) AS balance
    FROM transactions
   GROUP BY account
);
```

You know the drill - repeat with Bob in pgAdmin.

---

## Materialized views

More like actual tables - needs to be refreshed when the source gets updated.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW matbalance AS (
  SELECT account,
         sum(amount) AS balance
    FROM transactions
   GROUP BY account
);
```

Same as the regular view.

  * Try selecting from both to confirm they return the same data
  * Add a row to `transactions`
  * Select from both again. What's different now?

--

Materialized views must be updated with

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW matbalance;
```

---
layout: false


## Clean up

```sql
RESET ROLE;
```

Delete contents of table (but keep table)

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE alice.transactions;
```

Delete object

```sql
DROP { TABLE | VIEW | SCHEMA | etc. } name;
```

Delete whole schema and everything in it

```sql
DROP SCHEMA alice CASCADE;
```

Delete user

```sql
DROP USER alice;
```

# Performance

analyzing queries and boosting performance with indexes

---

## EXPLAIN ANALYZE

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM flights
 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM planes
                WHERE tailnum = flights.tailnum)
   AND origin = 'JFK';
```

In pgAdmin: type in a query (without `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) and hit F7

![:center 75%](input/figs/query-plan.svg)

---

## Indexes

Stored information about the sorting of a column, speeds up `WHERE` clauses.

  * Can be created for single or multiple columns
  * Speedup gained when using all indexed columns (with `WHERE` and `AND`)
  * Indexes can be unique (but doesn't have to be)
  * Primary keys
    * Implies non-`NULL` unique index

--

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
  ON table_name
  USING btree
  (col1, col2, ...);
```

???
This is the syntax for creating an index in SQL.

  * `USING` algorithm can be one of several, usually `btree` is best choice
  * One or more columns to index in the list

---

## Motivating example

In `testdb`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE huge_data_table AS
  SELECT s, round(s/10000, 0) AS s_round
    FROM generate_series(1, 10000000) s;
```

--

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  SELECT AVG(s)
  FROM huge_data_table
  WHERE s_round = 10;
```

--

```sql
CREATE INDEX s_round_index
  ON huge_data_table
  USING btree
  (s_round);
```

## Exercise

In the `nycflights13` database:

  * Create a copy of `flights` without indexes:

  ```sql
  SELECT * INTO flights_noindex FROM flights;
  ```

  * Look up the indexes on `flights`; both via pgAdmin and using the catalog:

  ```sql
  SELECT tablename, indexname, indexdef
    FROM pg_indexes
   WHERE tablename = 'flights';
  ```

  * Come up with some queries whose query plan are different when running them on `flights` and `flights_noindex`, respectively

## Import and export

Save table to CSV file:

```sql
COPY airlines TO '/tmp/airlines.csv' WITH (
  FORMAT csv,
  HEADER true,
  DELIMITER ','
);
```

--

Import table from CSV file:

```sql
CREATE TABLE airlines2 (carrier text, name text);
